# Explorer Dates

**Explorer Dates** brings file modification timestamps directly into VS Code's Explorer sidebar. See when files were last modified with intuitive time badges like `5m`, `2h`, `3d` - no more cryptic single characters!

## Features

- **Date Decorations**: Shows last modified dates directly in the Explorer sidebar
- **Smart Formatting**: Recent files show relative time (e.g., "5min", "2hr", "yesterday"), older files show absolute dates
- **Non-intrusive**: Subtle decorations that don't clutter your workspace
- **Performance**: Intelligent caching and file watching for smooth performance
- **Configurable**: Toggle decorations on/off, choose formatting style, enable color-coding
- **Customizable Time Format**: Choose between short (`5m`) or long (`5 mins`) format
- **Color-Coding**: Optional color-coding based on file recency (green: <1 hour, yellow: <1 day, red: >1 day)
- **Flexible Timestamp Display**: Toggle between relative (`5m ago`) and absolute (`October 12, 2025`) timestamps

## How It Works

The extension uses VS Code's `FileDecorationProvider` API to add date information as subtle badges next to file names in the Explorer. No separate panels or views - the dates appear directly where you need them.

**Date Format Examples:**
- Recent files: `now`, `5min`, `2hr`, `yesterday`  
- This year: `Oct 5`, `Sep 12`, `Jan 3`
- Older files: `Dec '23`, `Mar '22`

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Date decorations will automatically appear in the Explorer
3. Hover over any decoration to see detailed information:
   - Last modified date with exact timestamp and timezone
   - File creation date with exact timestamp and timezone
   - Git blame information (author name, email, and date) if the file is in a Git repository
4. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Refresh Date Decorations" to manually refresh

## Configuration

The extension provides several configuration options to customize the date decorations:

### Basic Settings

- `explorerDates.showDateDecorations`: Enable/disable date decorations (default: `true`)
- `explorerDates.dateDecorationFormat`: Choose format style - `smart`, `relative`, or `absolute` (default: `smart`)

### Time Badge Format

- `explorerDates.timeBadgeFormat`: Choose between short or long format (default: `short`)
  - **short**: Compact format like `5m`, `2h`, `3d`, `1w`
  - **long**: Descriptive format like `5 mins`, `2 hrs`, `3 days`, `1 week`

### Timestamp Format

- `explorerDates.timestampFormat`: Toggle between relative and absolute timestamps (default: `relative`)
  - **relative**: Shows time elapsed like `5m`, `2h`, `yesterday`
  - **absolute**: Shows actual date like `Oct 12`, `Mar 23, 2024`

### Color-Coding

- `explorerDates.enableColorCoding`: Enable color-coding based on file recency (default: `false`)
  - **Green**: Files modified within the last hour
  - **Yellow**: Files modified within the last day
  - **Red**: Files modified more than a day ago

**Example configuration in settings.json:**

```json
{
  "explorerDates.showDateDecorations": true,
  "explorerDates.timeBadgeFormat": "long",
  "explorerDates.timestampFormat": "relative",
  "explorerDates.enableColorCoding": true
}
```

## Inspiration & Motivation

*Inspired by the original explorer-plus concept, but completely reimplemented using VS Code's native FileDecorationProvider API for better performance and integration.*
